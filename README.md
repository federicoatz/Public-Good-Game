# Public-Good-Game
Public Good Game Practice App for oTree.
This repository contains files for creating a Public Good Game in HTML that is useful as a practice round for economic experiments. 
An easily editable 5-minute timeout is set.
Warning: the game, as programmed, does not store any information about the player's actions because it is designed as a practice round. If player decisions were to be stored, creating the variables and linking them within the HTML is a good idea.
